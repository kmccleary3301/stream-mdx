# @stream-mdx/unified

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- 28f8a1e: Remove `blockRenderer` and the `BlockComponents` registry. Use `components: NodePresentations` for native block wrappers and views, including unified rendering.
- 59622ba: Add `components: NodePresentations` to static/server and unified rendering, using the same native-node wrapper/view dispatch as streaming. Unified's HAST element mapping moves to `hastComponents`.
- 159a237: Use source-owned records for root code fences, tables, and paragraphs, with bounded line, row, and span updates and on-demand full-source reads. Patch consumers must accept wire protocol 2.0, replace `appendLines` with `appendCode`, adopt `appendParagraph` and `updateParagraphSpans`, and handle native table operations; the retired operation has no compatibility alias. Plugins must use the source snapshot and on-demand `readBlocks` document context instead of a retained `blocks` array.

  Live consumers now initialize one canonical root input document from the
  `INITIALIZED` snapshot baseline and retain later admitted bytes with ordered
  semantic `appendInputSource` root patches. Missing live baselines are
  incompatible; cold `Block[]` and standalone snapshots keep only their honest
  per-block source slices. Native code, table, and paragraph windows share the
  consumer input document while retaining independent owner generations and
  exact newly owned `sourceAppend` suffixes. Empty baselines are valid, and static
  artifact version 1 is unchanged.

  Preserve owner identity and retirement guards when replacing active snapshots. Reject regressing revisions and source frontiers, while allowing valid source-stable table and paragraph dependency meaning updates after finalization. Same-generation finalized source cannot grow or reopen. Keep final code highlighting and fallback presentation intact without retransmitting source in presentation-only patches.

  For paragraph owners after raw Markdown EOF, reopen only the actual trailing paragraph under a fresh owner generation. Do not fuse intervening definition or root source into an earlier paragraph. Keep genuinely unowned provisional following roots eligible for continuation.

  Do not re-finalize completed paragraph owners when later roots extend the shared input. Preserve their original parser frontier and captured source while still publishing valid late dependency changes.

  Queue imperative append and finalize calls behind their matching initialization acknowledgement. Ignore errors from detached or superseded initializations without changing public worker attachment readiness, and keep detached snapshot callbacks callable.

  Render managed paragraph children through the native span view while preserving registered source props and finalized block overrides. Default appends avoid global block/MDX scans; legacy full-source custom props use an explicit cold projection. Cold Block exports also retain admitted open native tables.

  Blocks whose rendering depends on HTML stay on the base HTML grouping path. Genuine inline-HTML paragraphs and HTML-bearing containers retire native owners instead of adopting or rehoming them; tail-local auto-close and native ownership for non-HTML blocks remain.

- 072e0f1: Expose generation-bound source reading and resolved link-reference metadata to node presentations, and report unified failures with block ID, type, and finalized state.

- Release the coordinated 1.0.0 package line. Upgrade all installed StreamMDX packages together and recopy the hosted worker from the matching version. Internal runtime dependencies remain exact versions; the optional unified adapter's StreamMDX peers require the 1.x line.

  Migration from 0.5.0:

  - Remove imports of `@stream-mdx/plugins/registry`, `/base`, and `/math`, their `stream-mdx/plugins/*` convenience re-exports, and `@stream-mdx/worker/streaming/custom-matcher`. `PluginRegistry`, `globalPluginRegistry`, legacy match handlers, and legacy math plugin factories are no longer public. Use native Lezer extensions, serializable `SyntaxRuleSpec` rules, and per-engine `DocumentPluginRegistry` document plugins. Native extension functions belong in the engine or custom worker bundle, not in structured-clone `INIT` messages.
  - `MarkdownEngine` owns its parser, queue, document state, plugins, and caches. Construct it with `{ post, extensions? }`, send configuration and document resets through `handle({ type: "INIT", ... })`, and call terminal `dispose()` when finished. Use public `serveMarkdownWorker` and `createInlineEngineWorker` factories instead of old global runtime plumbing. Worker URLs and actual Worker factories create renderer-owned workers that terminate on detach; an existing Worker is caller-owned. Caller-created inline adapters also need caller-owned termination. See `docs/PUBLIC_API.md` and `docs/PLUGIN_ABI.md` for supported wiring.
    `managedWorker={true}` requires a supplied Worker instance or caller-accessible factory and caller-owned initialization/document commands. URL/default workers and `engine="main-thread"` are rejected, even with a supplied worker source. Managed auto cannot silently fall back inline. Borrowed instances remain caller-owned; factory-created workers remain component-owned and terminate on detach.
  - Provisional lookahead inputs over 512 characters now return raw text before completeness scanning, including closed strings. Oversized finalized/nonprovisional complete content is preserved; within-budget finalized projection retains its behavior. Internal defaults are `maxScanChars: 512`, `maxNewlines: 2`, `maxSyntheticOps: 6`, `maxNestingDepth: 8`, `maxValidationFailures: 1`, and `maxProviderMs: 5`. Provider timers start before scanning; these caps are not React props or latency guarantees.
  - Core root exports no longer expose Lezer converter, math extension factory, link-label normalization, entity decoder, or default/regex plugin adapter internals. Use retained parser/preparation APIs and public worker/compiler entries. Owning parser settings remain authoritative, including disabled math in nested snapshot fallbacks.
  - `ComponentRegistry` treats a block component as custom only when it differs from the built-in default. Custom paragraph and quote wrappers must render the supplied `children` projection to retain native inline, HTML, and nested-block ownership. Do not reconstruct those children from raw source.
  - `CodeFenceRendererProps.renderCode` is a React node, not a callback. Return it directly as a fallback. `language`, fence metadata, and emitted `language-*` classes preserve the authored info word, such as `js`, rather than the canonical Shiki grammar name. Renderer lookups still fall back to canonical names and accept aliases. Unlabeled and indented code has no language class or `data-language` attribute.
  - `restart()` cancels the current async iterator generation; it does not replay a consumed iterator. Supply a fresh iterator for a new stream. Renderer-owned text replacements reset the engine document, while caller-initialized managed workers retain their document ownership.
  - URL transformation and HTML/style sanitization now apply across native client rendering, SSR, and the optional unified adapter. Rejected URLs are omitted; custom components must honor the supplied sanitized attributes and children. `allowedElements` and `disallowedElements` are mutually exclusive.

  The remaining consumed changesets describe the new opt-in renderers, controls, animation, table virtualization, themes, native extension APIs, and correctness/security fixes. These features do not enable themselves when upgrading. See the root README migration section and the generated package changelogs before upgrading custom integrations.

### Minor Changes

- 7879ed5: Add isolated MarkdownEngine instances, the public worker/engine entry, custom bundled worker serving, and a main-thread Worker adapter. React supports explicit worker, main-thread, and auto execution modes with a dynamically imported creation-time fallback. Updating onError no longer restarts streamed content.

  Add serializable inline syntax rules with capture attributes, recursively parsed content, lookahead, streaming anticipation, and invalid-INIT recovery. Native worker entries accept Lezer markdown/inline extensions and instance document plugins. HTML supports per-tag attribute lists, mapped components, and opt-in markdown children while retaining literal raw-block defaults and respecting disabled math. Preserve whitespace beyond the required four columns on internal indented-code blank lines, including nested containers. Include invisible reference definitions when determining loose lists. Recognize bare FTP links with native GFM URL punctuation and parenthesis handling.

  Add code fence renderer registration, React-node code fallbacks, math renderer overrides, structured diff views, and sandboxed HTML artifacts with CSP and host link routing. Mermaid accepts the code fence renderer contract and confines invalid-diagram output to its block.

  Add the optional unified adapter for finalized-block remark/rehype transforms, explicit block routing, container replacement, synchronous SSR, asynchronous native fallback, error callbacks, and bounded per-renderer caches. Restore finalized heading levels from engine metadata before running remark and rehype plugins, preserving multiline Setext content and soft breaks. Cover compiler output and real inline-transport updates through the store-backed DOM renderer, including provisional rendering and terminal finalization. Document public exports and replace obsolete plugin factory examples.

  React's minor version change covers public props (engine, codeRenderers, mathRenderer, blockRenderer) and renderer extension modes. Table virtualization is recorded separately in measured-table-rows, and nested block snapshot fixes are recorded in prepared-nested-blocks.

### Patch Changes

- e02e7cf: Security hardening: render-time URL transformation across client and SSR, raw HTML attribute and style sanitization, unified HAST URL sanitization, and ArtifactFrame height validation.

  - `@stream-mdx/core`: Replaced dead URL sanitization code with `defaultUrlTransform(url, attribute, context)` which sanitizes URLs for `href` and `src` attributes. Rejects `javascript:`, `vbscript:`, `file:`, and unapproved `data:` URLs (allowing only `data:image/(png|gif|jpeg|webp|avif)` on `src`), while permitting relative paths, fragments, and custom schemes so CommonMark conformance stays at 675/675. In HTML schemas, `on*` event handlers and `srcdoc` attributes are strictly forbidden regardless of user `allowedTags` configuration, and `script` tags are never permitted. Exported `sanitizeStyle` for DOM-free CSS style sanitization.
  - `@stream-mdx/react`: Added `urlTransform` prop to `<StreamingMarkdown />`, `ComponentRegistry`, and `MarkdownBlocksRenderer`. Applied at render time across link and image node views, raw HTML attributes (`href`, `src`, `action`, `formaction`, `xlink:href`), SSR rendering, and `openLink`/`linkSafety` navigation (preventing unsafe scheme execution). Raw HTML `style` attributes now enforce the DOM-free CSS property allowlist (dropping `position`, `url()`, backslash escapes, and expressions while retaining colors and fonts). `ArtifactFrame` strictly verifies `Number.isFinite(data.height)` and clamps between 50 and 10000 px, ignoring `NaN` and `Infinity`.
  - `@stream-mdx/unified`: Added `urlTransform` option to `createUnifiedRenderer` that applies URL sanitization via a final HAST transformation pass after user rehype plugins without stripping user classes.
