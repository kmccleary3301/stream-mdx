# @stream-mdx/mermaid

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- Release the coordinated 1.0.0 package line. Upgrade all installed StreamMDX packages together and recopy the hosted worker from the matching version. Internal runtime dependencies remain exact versions; the optional unified adapter's StreamMDX peers require the 1.x line.

  Migration from 0.5.0:

  - Remove imports of `@stream-mdx/plugins/registry`, `/base`, and `/math`, their `stream-mdx/plugins/*` convenience re-exports, and `@stream-mdx/worker/streaming/custom-matcher`. `PluginRegistry`, `globalPluginRegistry`, legacy match handlers, and legacy math plugin factories are no longer public. Use native Lezer extensions, serializable `SyntaxRuleSpec` rules, and per-engine `DocumentPluginRegistry` document plugins. Native extension functions belong in the engine or custom worker bundle, not in structured-clone `INIT` messages.
  - `MarkdownEngine` owns its parser, queue, document state, plugins, and caches. Construct it with `{ post, extensions? }`, send configuration and document resets through `handle({ type: "INIT", ... })`, and call terminal `dispose()` when finished. Use public `serveMarkdownWorker` and `createInlineEngineWorker` factories instead of old global runtime plumbing. Worker URLs and actual Worker factories create renderer-owned workers that terminate on detach; an existing Worker is caller-owned. Caller-created inline adapters also need caller-owned termination. See `docs/PUBLIC_API.md` and `docs/PLUGIN_ABI.md` for supported wiring.
    `managedWorker={true}` requires a supplied Worker instance or caller-accessible factory and caller-owned initialization/document commands. URL/default workers and `engine="main-thread"` are rejected, even with a supplied worker source. Managed auto cannot silently fall back inline. Borrowed instances remain caller-owned; factory-created workers remain component-owned and terminate on detach.
  - Provisional lookahead inputs over 512 characters now return raw text before completeness scanning, including closed strings. Oversized finalized/nonprovisional complete content is preserved; within-budget finalized projection retains its behavior. Internal defaults are `maxScanChars: 512`, `maxNewlines: 2`, `maxSyntheticOps: 6`, `maxNestingDepth: 8`, `maxValidationFailures: 1`, and `maxProviderMs: 5`. Provider timers start before scanning; these caps are not React props or latency guarantees.
  - Core root exports no longer expose Lezer converter, math extension factory, link-label normalization, entity decoder, or default/regex plugin adapter internals. Use retained parser/preparation APIs and public worker/compiler entries. Owning parser settings remain authoritative, including disabled math in nested snapshot fallbacks.
  - `ComponentRegistry` treats a block component as custom only when it differs from the built-in default. Custom paragraph and quote wrappers must render the supplied `children` projection to retain native inline, HTML, and nested-block ownership. Do not reconstruct those children from raw source.
  - `CodeFenceRendererProps.renderCode` is a React node, not a callback. Return it directly as a fallback. `language`, fence metadata, and emitted `language-*` classes preserve the authored info word, such as `js`, rather than the canonical Shiki grammar name. Renderer lookups still fall back to canonical names and accept aliases. Unlabeled and indented code has no language class or `data-language` attribute.
  - `restart()` cancels the current async iterator generation; it does not replay a consumed iterator. Supply a fresh iterator for a new stream. Renderer-owned text replacements reset the engine document, while caller-initialized managed workers retain their document ownership.
  - URL transformation and HTML/style sanitization now apply across native client rendering, SSR, and the optional unified adapter. Rejected URLs are omitted; custom components must honor the supplied sanitized attributes and children. `allowedElements` and `disallowedElements` are mutually exclusive.

  The remaining consumed changesets describe the new opt-in renderers, controls, animation, table virtualization, themes, native extension APIs, and correctness/security fixes. These features do not enable themselves when upgrading. See the root README migration section and the generated package changelogs before upgrading custom integrations.

### Minor Changes

- 072e0f1: Add an optional Mermaid engine capability that routes Mermaid fences through the native code owner while Markdown parsing remains in the selected worker or main-thread engine.

- 05f4cfb: Add `createMermaidBlock` factory supporting custom Mermaid configuration, custom error components with retry, default view settings, debounce options, and custom Mermaid module instances or loaders. Serialize Mermaid rendering through a module queue so concurrent blocks with different configurations do not interleave, and preserve `securityLevel: 'strict'` by default.
- e2c13e5: Add `controls` prop to `StreamingMarkdown` and `MarkdownBlocksRenderer` (+ RendererConfig/registry) for code block, table, and Mermaid diagram copy and download actions.
  - Code blocks: copy raw authored code text (not highlighted HTML), download snippet with language-derived extension. Works for virtualized code.
  - Tables: copy as TSV or Markdown, download CSV, TSV, or Markdown built from finalized cell text with strict RFC 4180 escaping (quotes, commas, newlines). Disabled during streaming; enabled upon table finalization.
  - Mermaid & code-fence renderers: expose controls flags and `copy()` helper via `CodeFenceRendererProps`; `MermaidBlock` opts in to diagram source copying in its toolbar and code view.
  - Buttons: real `<button type="button">` with `aria-label`, `data-stream-mdx-control`, and styling classnames. SSR-safe with no window access during render.
  - Customization: support full replacement slot via `controlsComponent` prop / registry, and i18n label overrides via `controls.labels`.

### Patch Changes

- fa820ac: Cancel obsolete diagram jobs before provider side effects and invoke returned binding disposers when an artifact is replaced, Diagram view ends, or the block unmounts.

- 7879ed5: Add isolated MarkdownEngine instances, the public worker/engine entry, custom bundled worker serving, and a main-thread Worker adapter. React supports explicit worker, main-thread, and auto execution modes with a dynamically imported creation-time fallback. Updating onError no longer restarts streamed content.

  Add serializable inline syntax rules with capture attributes, recursively parsed content, lookahead, streaming anticipation, and invalid-INIT recovery. Native worker entries accept Lezer markdown/inline extensions and instance document plugins. HTML supports per-tag attribute lists, mapped components, and opt-in markdown children while retaining literal raw-block defaults and respecting disabled math. Preserve whitespace beyond the required four columns on internal indented-code blank lines, including nested containers. Include invisible reference definitions when determining loose lists. Recognize bare FTP links with native GFM URL punctuation and parenthesis handling.

  Add code fence renderer registration, React-node code fallbacks, math renderer overrides, structured diff views, and sandboxed HTML artifacts with CSP and host link routing. Mermaid accepts the code fence renderer contract and confines invalid-diagram output to its block.

  Add the optional unified adapter for finalized-block remark/rehype transforms, explicit block routing, container replacement, synchronous SSR, asynchronous native fallback, error callbacks, and bounded per-renderer caches. Restore finalized heading levels from engine metadata before running remark and rehype plugins, preserving multiline Setext content and soft breaks. Cover compiler output and real inline-transport updates through the store-backed DOM renderer, including provisional rendering and terminal finalization. Document public exports and replace obsolete plugin factory examples.

  React's minor version change covers public props (engine, codeRenderers, mathRenderer, blockRenderer) and renderer extension modes. Table virtualization is recorded separately in measured-table-rows, and nested block snapshot fixes are recorded in prepared-nested-blocks.
