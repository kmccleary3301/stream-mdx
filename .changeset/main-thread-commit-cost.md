Cut main-thread cost while streaming. The renderer store reuses one public block clone per unchanged block instead of re-cloning every block on each read. Structural invariants are scanned when `getInvariantViolations()` is read, not after every patch batch. Browser code-row sanitizing uses a preconfigured DOMPurify instance that applies the style policy during sanitizing, with no second parse. Task-list checkboxes no longer set the redundant `aria-checked` attribute; native checkboxes already expose their checked state.
