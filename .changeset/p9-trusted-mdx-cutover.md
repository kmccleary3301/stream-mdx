Replace per-block MDX compilation and status messages with native source blocks and an explicit whole-document trusted lane. Restricted source components must be registered through `defineContentComponent`; only serializable descriptors cross the worker boundary, while validators, components, and native children remain host-side. Remove the retired MDX compile-mode and hydration props and default artifact execution. Full MDX now requires `createTrustedMdxEngine`, an explicit host import map, trusted content, and CSP permission for `unsafe-eval`. Worker `FINALIZED` reports native semantic completion, not trusted preparation or render readiness.

Preserve literal quoted attribute text, including trailing backslashes, while retaining strict-JSON escape semantics and native HTML entity decoding. Freeze admitted JSON recursively after worker transport and freeze the host React props envelope in production. Generate client and server declarations with one output owner so the explicit trusted server entry remains importable.

Keep trusted flow and fragment children on their native heading, paragraph, code and table owners. Classify module declarations by exact compiler source ranges so successful imports/exports do not leak into Markdown output. Preserve strict native child ownership and independent document leases; source-span parsing remains outside the trusted compiler/evaluator graph.

Trusted replacements retain a detached native store captured once after a successful complete-module host commit. During a pending or failed replacement it remains labelled with its original source generation and document revision, keeps commit-time decorations, and sends no code jobs to the replacement worker. Reset, engine/cache invalidation or disposal, lease or policy changes, or a later successful commit release it. A retained React render error shows the captured source but does not roll back arbitrary trusted host effects.
