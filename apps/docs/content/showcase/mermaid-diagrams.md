# Mermaid diagrams

StreamMDX supports Mermaid as an opt-in addon. Use it to render diagrams from code blocks while keeping the rest of the stream fast and stable.

## What this showcases

- Mermaid blocks rendered with a code/preview toggle.
- Worker + React wiring that keeps the addon isolated from the core renderer.

## Next steps

- Read the guide: [Mermaid diagrams guide](/docs/guides/mermaid-diagrams)
- Use the addon in your app and keep it behind a feature flag for safety.
