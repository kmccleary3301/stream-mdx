# Perf harness

The perf harness drives StreamMDX through repeatable fixtures and captures p95 timing, long-task, and memory metrics. It is the source of truth for baseline comparisons.

## What this showcases

- Reproducible streaming runs (same fixture + scenario inputs).
- Guardrails that fail fast when metrics regress.
